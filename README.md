# Dublin Bikes Live
## Overview
Dublin Bikes Live is a realtime journey planner that supports the Dublin Bikes initiative. It has realtime availability data for over 100 stations, up-to-date weather information and a machine-learning power journey planner.

## Features
### Informational Pop-ups
Each station is represented by a marker on the map with availability trends for the past week and the the current day, as well as predicted availability for the rest of the day generated by our machine-learning model.

### Journey Planner
The journey planner let's you pick two locations, a departure and a arrival:
- it will automatically select the closest station to your departure with _available bikes_
- and the closest station to your arrival with available _parking_

It will let you know how far a walk the departure station is from your current location, the duration of your cycle (aided with cycle lanes super-imposed on the map), and how far a walk the arrival station is from your destination.

You get the option to select the current day, tomorrow or the next day as well as the time you would like to make your journey

### Export
People are a little attached to their maps: so use your own! The user can select directions and will export their journey to Google Maps so they can navigate in real time and even send it to their phone

## Deployment
This project is designed to fork nicely, with several helper scripts (thank you Python!) to get you up and running quickly once you've satisfied some prerequisites.
1. EC2 and RDS:
   - Deployment is straightforward with a free-tier EC2 instance running Ubuntu and associated RDS.
   - Free tier for both is more than sufficient, and setting up the EC2 before the RDS means you can link them and assure that they play nicely.
   - You will then need to make your own `constants.py` file to store your database credentials
2. Google Maps and weatherapi.com
   - You will need to make an account with both to get an API key which you will populate the `constants.py` file with appropriately
3. ...from the top
   - `db_conn_test.py` will make sure either your local or EC2 instance is connected to the database
   - `create_db.py` takes an argument for the city name (support for other contract cities would a brilliant reason to fork) and need to be run with (for Dublin, of course): `python create_db.py dublin`
   - This will create the necessary tables for storing bike availability and weather data (for display on the app and of course, training your own machine-learning models)
   - Finally `scrape.py` will begin scraping the data and storing it in the table
   - I _do not_ recommend running this as a continuous loop, you'll run out of memory after a couple of weeks (speaking from experience): use a _cron_ job instead
